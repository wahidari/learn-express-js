## Running the skeleton website

At this point, we have a complete skeleton project. The website doesn't actually  _do_  very much yet, but it's worth running it to show that it works.

1.  First, install the dependencies (the  `install`  command will fetch all the dependency packages listed in the project's **package.json**  file).
    
    ```bash
    cd learn-express
    npm install
    ```
    
2.  Then run the application.
       ```bash
	   npm start
    ```
        
3.  Then load  [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)  in your browser to access the app.
